Add the ability to save banks and accounts to a file

Add the ability to add a transaction
    Have the option to click a button that says "Today" to automatically fill 
    in today's date in the date field


Add the ability to save transaction history


Easier stuff:
Add a button that allows you to copy the bank routing number to your clipboard
 (see https://chrissainty.com/copy-to-clipboard-in-blazor/)


Should I make a reference from each account to its bank, each sub account to its account, 
and each custom category to its sub account? Just to make it safer so we don't end up 
losing one somehwere?


Add a way to delete custom categories
